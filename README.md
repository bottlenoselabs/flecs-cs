# flecs-cs

Automatically updated C# bindings for https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs with native dynamic link libraries.

## How to use

### From source

1. Download and install [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Fork the repository using GitHub or clone the repository manually with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/flecs-cs`.
3. Build the native library by running `library.sh`. To execute `.sh` scripts on Windows, use Git Bash which can be installed with Git itself: https://git-scm.com/download/win. The `library.sh` script requires that CMake is installed and in your path.
4. Import the MSBuild `flecs.props` file which is located in the root of this directory to your `.csproj` file to setup everything you need. See the [hello world sample](src\cs\samples\flecs-01_hello_world\flecs-01_hello_world.csproj) for an example of how to do this.
```xml
<!-- flecs: bindings + native library -->
<Import Project="$([System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath('path/to/flecs.props'))" />
```

#### Bindgen

If you wish to re-generate the bindings, run [`c2cs`](https://github.com/lithiumtoast/c2cs) from this directory.
